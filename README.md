# Kip 
Kip is toy programming language I'm making to understand how compilers work.


# Try it out

Run this command to compile the example file:
`cargo run example/main.kip -o main.ic`

Then open `main.ic` to see the output in three address code

# Features
- A handmade lexer
- A parser
# Resources
I took inspiration from a lot of resources so here are all of them:
- ["My First Language Frontend with LLVM Tutorial"](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html)
- ["CS 143"](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs143/cs143.1128/)
- ["Crafting Interpreters"](http://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html)
- ["C Operator Precedence"](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_precedence)
- The Rust compiler itself
